This error occurs when using the Expo CLI to build an Android app and involves the `jetifier` process.  The specific error message might vary, but it usually points to issues transforming Java libraries to be compatible with AndroidX.  The root cause is often a conflict between different library versions that are not AndroidX-compatible or inconsistent versions used during the build process.
