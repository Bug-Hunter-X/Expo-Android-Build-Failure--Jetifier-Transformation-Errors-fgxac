## Expo Android Build Failure: Jetifier Transformation Errors

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when building Android apps with Expo CLI: jetifier transformation errors.  These errors stem from incompatibility between libraries and AndroidX, the modern Android support library.

The `bug.js` file showcases a simplified project structure that might lead to this error, illustrating dependencies that are problematic.  `bugSolution.js` demonstrates how to resolve this issue using updated compatible versions of necessary packages.

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `expo start`.
4. Attempt to build the Android app using `expo build:android`. You should encounter the jetifier transformation errors.
5. Check out and run `bugSolution.js` to see the fix in action.

### Solution

The primary solution is carefully examining your project's `package.json` file and updating any conflicting or outdated dependencies to their AndroidX-compatible equivalents.  Sometimes, simply upgrading React Native and Expo SDK versions resolves the issue.
