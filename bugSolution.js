The solution typically involves updating the app's dependencies to ensure compatibility with AndroidX. This might involve using the latest versions of React Native, Expo, and any other libraries causing conflicts.  One way to identify the conflict is to carefully examine the error messages generated by the jetifier process which often identify the problematic package. Update the package.json, run `expo install`, then rebuild your app. If the problem persists, consider creating a minimal reproducible example to better diagnose the root cause.
